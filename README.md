# RER A Timeline application
## Build using Xcode
Edit the file RERA/Shared/Stations.json to suit your needs using the IDs returned by : https://api-ratp.pierre-grimaud.fr/v2/rers/a/stations coordinates can be obtained from Google Maps.

Compile and deploy to the apple watch.

## Further ideas
Currently, the iOS app is only a placeholder for the watchOS app. Below are some expansion ideas :
- a nice UI for customizing the stations would be the logical next step
- the download could be moved to the iOS part
- download could be triggered when approaching from a station
